# sanfrancisco_crime_reports

## Project Intent

This project is to utilize machine learning algorithms to classify the status of crimes in San Francisco based on data retrieved from Kaggle. The models used will be evaluated and compared to determine the most feasible model for the dataset.

## Models

### Randon Forest

Random Forest from scikit learn library was utilized to conduct a prelimanary analysis on the data. The next iteration on the model was putting weights and conducting a K-Fold cross validation.

PCA was also implemented to determine the features that affect the classification of cases.
